# MathSocial

Math Social is a web application that generates math word problems for elementary students. When a student logs in, they will see a mini-feed with problems their math buddies have solved, and they can comment on their math buddies solutions. A student can also view their math portfolio of problems they have solved in the past or click investigate to solve a new problem. Students can create, view, edit, or delete solutions and comments. They can also add or remove math buddies in their class.
